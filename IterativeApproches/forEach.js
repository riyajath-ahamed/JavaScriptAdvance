const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

numbers.forEach((number) => {

// Output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5

// The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each array element.
// The forEach() method does not return anything. It simply iterates over the array elements and calls the provided function for each element.
// The forEach() method is an alternative to using a for loop to iterate over an array. It provides a more concise and readable way 
//    to iterate over array elements.
// The forEach() method takes a callback function as an argument. This callback function is executed for each element in the array.
// The callback function can take up to three arguments: the current element, the index of the current element, and the array being traversed.
// In the example above, the forEach() method is used to iterate over the numbers array and log each element to the console. The output shows 
//      each element of the array printed to the console. 
// The forEach() method is commonly used to perform an action on each element of an array, such as updating the elements, logging them to the 
//      console, or performing some other operation.
// The forEach() method is supported in all modern browsers, including Internet Explorer 9 and above.
// The forEach() method is a higher-order function, meaning it takes a function as an argument or returns a function as a result.
// The forEach() method is a simple and straightforward way to iterate over array elements and perform an action on each element.
// The forEach() method is a useful tool for working with arrays in JavaScript and is commonly used in functional programming.
// The forEach() method is a versatile and flexible tool that can be used in a wide variety of scenarios to process and manipulate arrays.
// The forEach() method is a powerful tool for working with arrays in JavaScript and is commonly used in functional programming.
